# CollabForge

**Let the world finish what you started.**

A collaborative music platform where artists release unfinished songs to the community. Anyone can remix, rewrite, or reimagine them. The community decides which version wins.

## 🎵 How It Works

### For Artists
1. Upload your raw, unfinished track
2. Give up control — let the world have it
3. Watch as others remix and reimagine it
4. Your original stays pinned at the top
5. Earn 60% royalties if it goes commercial

### For Remixers
1. Find songs that speak to you
2. Download, add to it, change anything
3. Upload your version
4. Community votes with likes
5. Top 10 versions are featured
6. Split royalties if yours wins

### Completion
- A song is "Complete" when any version hits 1,000 likes
- Complete songs can be distributed to Spotify, Apple Music, etc.
- Original creator gets 60%, contributors split 40%
- Special case: If original version wins, creator gets 100%

## 💡 The Philosophy

This isn't about making hits. It's about **release**. **Catharsis**. Getting the song out of your head so it stops rotting inside you.

Once you post it, it belongs to the world. You just get to watch what happens.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Vanilla JS (no framework bloat)
- **Backend:** Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + Storage)
- **Hosting:** Vercel (global CDN)
- **Domain:** collabforge.io

**Cost:** $0/month until you have real traction.
